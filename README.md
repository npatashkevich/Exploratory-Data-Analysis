# **Apartment Rental Price Prediction**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict apartment rental prices in Moscow. Our goal is to improve the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** from **50% to 30% or lower**.

## **Objectives**

### **1. Understanding the Data**
- We analyzed the dataset (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA) to find patterns and trends.
- Identified key factors affecting rental prices.

### **2. Cleaning the Data**
- Removed missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.
- Standardized data formats for better consistency.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Created new features (e.g., Building Type, Floor Number) to improve predictions.
- Transformed categorical variables and scaled numerical values.

### **4. Preparing Data for Model Training**
- Finalized the dataset with relevant features.
- Ensured all data was structured correctly for machine learning algorithms.

## **Key Findings**
- **Apartment size, number of rooms, distance to city center and metro station** strongly influence rental prices.
- Cleaning the dataset improved the reliability of the data.
- Adding extra features improved the modelâ€™s performance.

## **Visualizations**
- Graphs showing how price changes with different features.
- Correlation matrix displaying relationships between variables.
